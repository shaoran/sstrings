The Safe String Library
=======================

Version 1.0.3
-------------

1. What is sstrings?
--------------------

Safe Strings is a small C library that handles C strings in a safe way. 
The functions of this library look at the necessary space for the operations 
and try to reserve that space (with malloc or realloc). The functions only 
begin working with their tasks when the memory allocation is successful.

2. System specifications
------------------------

This library should ne compiled by any ANSI C compiler. The configure
and Makefile.in files were created by the GNU Build System (autoconf,
automake, etc) and will function with any POSIX System. Note: if you want
to create a Windows Library, you have to create you own Makefiles that
run with the Microsoft Visual Stdio. There is no warranty that this function
unter Windows.

3. Documentation
----------------

Once installed you can see the documentation using the man command, each
function has its own manual page on section 3. There is a manual page
sstrings(5) on section 5 where you can find general information about
the library and a the list of functions available.

You may visit the homepage http://freshmeat.net/redir/sstrings/56606/url_homepage/sstrings
and read the online documentation.

4. Using the library
--------------------

To use the library you have to include the sstrings.h file on any C/C++ program.
Note that it is better to use this library only with C. C++ has std::string and it
is a much better idea to use this while programming with C++.

Linking this library with a GNU GCC C compiler must be done by passing the -lsstrings
option when linking the project.

5. License
----------

This library is publicated under the term of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Please read the license in the same directory, the file is COPYING.
